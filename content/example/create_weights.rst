Interface Weights
=================

Here, the code **interface_weights.exe** and the input file **interface_weights.inp** (:ref:`see format <e3d_input_weights>`) are used to create interface weights. Files relevant to this part of the example are in the sub-folder *create_weights*. For this example, we use the mesh that was created in the example ":ref:`create model<example_octree>`". Before running this example, you may want to do the following:

	- `Download and open the zip folder containing the entire E3D version 2 example <https://github.com/ubcgif/E3D/raw/e3dinv_ver2/assets/E3D_manual_ver2.zip>`__ (if not done already)
	- :ref:`Learn how to run code from command line <e3d_weights>`
	- :ref:`Learn the format of the input file <e3d_input_weights>`

To create interface weights, the following input file was used:
