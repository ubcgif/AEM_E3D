Examples
========

Here, the program libraries for E3D version 2 will be used to:

	- create an Octree mesh based on the survey
	- create octree models
	- predict FEM data for a synthetic model
	- create interface weights
	- invert FEM data created using our synthetic model

Zip folders containing all necessary files can be downloaded here:

	- `Files for example using E3D version 2 <https://github.com/ubcgif/E3D/raw/e3dinv_ver2/assets/E3D_manual_ver2.zip>`__
