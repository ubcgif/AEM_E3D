E3D version 2 tiled package
===========================

.. important:: E3D version 2 tiled performs forward modeling and inversion with the executable **e3dinv_ver2_tiled.exe**. Past iterations of this code may have been given the name 'AEM.exe', although its application is not limited to airborne. To use this code, ensure you have downloaded 'e3dinv_ver2_tiled.exe' and all related file from the UBC-GIF website.

E3D version 2 tiled is a program library for carrying out forward modelling and inversion of frequency domain EM data over 3D structures. Unlike E3D version 2, the E3D version 2 'tiled' code performs the forward modeling in parallel on a set of local OcTree meshes. The contents of this manual are as follows:
